The 2025 Google Ads Playbook for Cleaning Companies
Why Some Cleaning Companies Pay $29 Per Lead While Others Pay $324
Based on Real Analysis: $98,530 in Ad Spend | 12 Companies | 1,468 Leads | July-November 2025
________________


What You're About to Learn
This isn't theory or best practices from some marketing blog.
This is real performance data from real cleaning companies.
Between July and November 2025, we analyzed every Google Ad from 12 cleaning companies who collectively spent $98,530 to generate 1,468 leads.
What we found was shocking:
* Best performer: $29.26 cost per lead
* Worst performer: $323.99 cost per lead
* That's an 11x difference for the same type of lead
The difference?
Three things: Ad copy, campaign settings, and targeting.
This playbook shows you exactly what the winners did differently.

Part 1: The Ad Copy That Actually Converts
The Data: 5,606 Ad Variations Analyzed
We analyzed every headline and description combination from these 12 companies.
The pattern was crystal clear:
Some ad copy converts at 28%. Some ad copy converts at 0.1%.
That's a 280x difference from just changing a few words.
________________


The Headlines That Win (20-28% Conversion Rate)
These headlines converted at 20-28% (industry average is 3-5%):
1. Location + Authority = Gold
28.6% Conversion Rate | $81.83 CPA:
* "Austin's Top Maid Service"
* "{LOCATION(City)}'s Top Maid Service"
* "Maid Service in {LOCATION(City)}"
28.1% Conversion Rate | $28.91 CPA:
* "#1 Cleaning Service In Denver"
* "Denver's #1 Rated Cleaners"
27.2% Conversion Rate | $30.24 CPA:
* "[Brand Name] | [City]"
* "Serving {LOCATION(City)}"
Why it works: People search for LOCAL services. When you say "Denver's #1" instead of "near you," you match their intent exactly.
2. Strong, Direct CTAs
28.1% Conversion Rate | $28.91 CPA:
* "Schedule Your House Cleaning"
* "Get a Free Quote Here"
27.4% Conversion Rate | $23.49 CPA:
* "Request A Home Cleaning Quote"
26.3% Conversion Rate | $31.20 CPA:
* "Get a Free Quote Or Book Today"
Why it works: Tells them exactly what to do. No friction. No confusion.
3. Trust Signals That Actually Matter
28.1% Conversion Rate | $28.91 CPA:
* "Trusted & Highly Recommended"
* "Green Seal Certified Cleaners"
* "Easy, Flat Rate Pricing"
28.4% Conversion Rate | $21.69 CPA:
* "Residential Clean Done Right"
Why it works: Third-party validation reduces risk. Pricing transparency removes anxiety.
4. Brand + Location (If You Have Good Reviews)
27.4% Conversion Rate:
* "[Brand Name] Cleaning Services"
27.2% Conversion Rate | $30.24 CPA:
* "[Brand Name] | [City]"
34.9% CTR (highest in dataset):
* "[Brand Name] Cleaning"
Why it works: If you have reviews and brand recognition, lean into it. Brand builds trust.
5. Service Specificity
28.6% Conversion Rate:
* "{Keyword:Local Maid Service}"
* "{Keyword:Recurring Cleaning Services}"
28.4% Conversion Rate | $21.69 CPA:
* "Residential Clean Done Right"
Why it works: Matches search intent precisely. They searched "maid service," you say "maid service."

The Headlines That Tank (0-3% Conversion Rate)
These headlines wasted thousands of dollars:
Generic "Near You" Copy (AVOID)
0.1% Conversion Rate (yes, really):
* "Deep Cleaning Service Near You"
3.3% Conversion Rate:
* "Cleaning Service Near You"
* "Regular Cleaning Near You"
3.5% Conversion Rate:
* "Locations Near You"
Why it fails: Vague, sounds like a directory listing, no differentiation from competition.
Emotional Fluff Without Substance
1.0% Conversion Rate:
* "Clean Home, Fresh Start"
* "Clean House, Happy Life"
* "Save Time For Yourself"
2.7% Conversion Rate:
* "Sparkling Homes, Happy Lives"
Why it fails: Cliché, no specific reason to choose YOU over competitors.
Feature Dumps
1.0% Conversion Rate:
* "Safe for Your Family and Pets"
2.7% Conversion Rate:
* "Eco Friendly Products"
3.5% Conversion Rate:
* "Safe Cleaning for Pets & Kids"
Why it fails: These are table stakes. Everyone says this. Not a differentiator.
Weak Help Language
2.7% Conversion Rate:
* "We're Here to Help"
* "Call Us Today"
2.8% Conversion Rate:
* "Request A Quote" (when not combined with anything specific)
1.0% Conversion Rate:
* "We Make Moving Easy"
Why it fails: Could be ANY service business. No specificity. No compelling reason to click.
Just Service Names
2.7% Conversion Rate:
* "Deep House Cleaning"
* "Move In/Move Out Cleaning"
* "Power Washing"
Why it fails: Just stating what you do isn't compelling. Need differentiation.

The Pattern: What Winners Do vs What Losers Do
Winners (20-28% conversion):
* ✅ Specific city names ("Denver," "Austin," "St. Louis")
* ✅ Authority claims ("#1," "Top," "Most Trusted")
* ✅ Direct CTAs ("Schedule," "Get Quote")
* ✅ Trust signals (certifications, ratings, guarantees)
* ✅ Service specificity ("Maid Service" not just "Cleaning")
Losers (0-3% conversion):
* ❌ Generic location ("near you," "in your area")
* ❌ No differentiation (everyone says it)
* ❌ Vague promises (emotional fluff)
* ❌ Weak CTAs ("call us")
* ❌ Feature dumps without context

Part 2: Campaign Settings That Matter
The Campaigns That Work (Data-Backed)
Based on our analysis, here are the campaign types and settings that generated the best results:
Campaign Type: Search Only
What worked:
* Standard Search campaigns
* Responsive Search Ads
What didn't work:
* Display Network (wasted $255 with 0 conversions for one company)
* Performance Max (inconsistent, hard to optimize)
Best CPAs came from pure Search campaigns:
* Company A: $29.26 CPA (Search only)
* Company B: $30.24 CPA (Search only)
* Company C: $35.58 CPA (Search only)
Recommendation: Turn off Display Network and Search Partners. Run Search campaigns only.
________________


Campaign Structure: Keep It Simple
Winning campaign structures from the data:
1. Brand Campaign (Separate)
* Your company name keywords
* Defensive bidding
* Usually lowest CPA
Example: One company's brand campaign - $84.77 CPA (vs $203 for generic)
2. Service-Specific Campaigns
* One campaign per major service type
* House cleaning / Maid service / Deep cleaning / Move in-out
Example: One company's house cleaning campaign - $30.24 CPA with 27% conversion
3. Location-Specific (If Multi-Location)
* Separate campaigns or ad groups by city
Don't overcomplicate it. The best performers had 1-3 simple campaigns.
________________


Geographic Targeting: Be Specific
What the data shows:
Ads with specific city names converted at 27%. Ads with "near you" converted at 0.1%.
That's 270x worse.
Recommended targeting:
* Use radius targeting (10-15 miles max from service area)
* Exclude areas you don't serve
* Bid higher in affluent zip codes
* Use location insertion in ads: {LOCATION(City)}
Example from the data:
* Denver-specific campaigns: $28-30 CPA
* Generic "near you" campaigns: $200+ CPA
________________


Settings Checklist
Turn ON:
* ✅ Search Network
* ✅ Call extensions
* ✅ Location extensions
* ✅ Sitelink extensions
* ✅ Callout extensions
* ✅ Conversion tracking
Turn OFF:
* ❌ Display Network
* ❌ Search Partners (test, but usually worse)
* ❌ Performance Max (for now)
* ❌ "Optimized" targeting (gives Google too much control)
Best practice from winners: Keep tight control. Don't let Google expand beyond your target areas.

Part 3: The Numbers That Actually Matter
Performance Benchmarks (From Real Data)
Here's what "good" looks like based on the 12 companies analyzed:
Metric
	Poor
	Average
	Good
	Elite
	Cost Per lead
	$100+
	$50-100
	$30-50
	<$30
	Conversion Rate
	<8%
	8-12%
	12-20%
	20%+
	CTR
	<4%
	4-5%
	5-7%
	7%+
	CPC
	$10+
	$7-10
	$5-7
	<$5
	Where do you fall?
If your CPA is above $100, you have major optimization opportunities (like Company E in our dataset).
If your CPA is $50-100, you're average and can improve significantly.
If your CPA is below $50, you're in the top 25%.
If your CPA is below $30, you're in the top 5% (like Companies A and B).

Part 4: What Winners vs Losers Actually Did
The Top Performers (CPA Under $50)
Company A: $29.26 CPA | 19.75% Conv Rate
What they did right:
* Used dynamic keyword insertion: "{KeyWord:House Cleaning}"
* Strong CTAs: "Get Your Home Cleaned Now"
* Kept campaigns simple and focused
* City-specific targeting
Best performing ad group: 25% conversion rate, $23.70 CPA
________________


Company B: $30.24 CPA | 27.09% Conv Rate (Highest conversion in dataset)
What they did right:
* Brand + Location formula: "[Brand] | [City]"
* Authority claims: "#1 Cleaning Service In [City]"
* Trust signals: "Green Seal Certified Cleaners"
* Multiple strong CTAs
Best performing ad group: 27% conversion rate (highest in entire dataset)
________________


Company C: $35.58 CPA | 13.56% Conv Rate
What they did right:
* Very low CPC ($4.82) through quality optimization
* Simple, clear headlines
* Focused on long-term client campaigns
* Consistent messaging
Result: Excellent efficiency with 13.56% conversion rate
________________


The Underperformers (CPA Over $100)
Company E: $104.52 CPA | 7.88% Conv Rate
Problems identified:
1. Brand campaign worked ($84.77 CPA)
2. Generic search campaign failed ($203.39 CPA)
3. Display campaign wasted money ($255 spent, 0 conversions)
4. Website traffic campaign disaster ($3,159 CPA!)
What needs fixing:
* Replace "near you" headlines with city-specific headlines
* Kill display and website traffic campaigns immediately
* Focus budget on brand campaign (which is working)
* Add city-specific copy throughout
Potential impact: Could drop CPA from $104 to $50-60 just by fixing ad copy and pausing bad campaigns.
________________


Company F: $116.38 CPA | 10.31% Conv Rate
Problems identified:
1. One geographic campaign worked ($80.72 CPA)
2. Second geographic campaign was a disaster ($488.35 CPA!)
What needs fixing:
* Pause the failing geographic campaign immediately
* Focus all budget on the working geography
* Fix ad copy if expanding again
Potential impact: Could drop CPA from $116 to $80 by cutting the bad geography alone.

Part 5: The One Change That Will 10x Your Results
If you only do ONE thing from this playbook:
Replace every instance of "near you" with your specific city name.
That's it.
The data:
* "Cleaning Service Near You" → 0.1% conversion rate
* "[City]'s Top Cleaning Service" → 27% conversion rate
That's 270x better from changing two words.
How to do it:
1. Log into Google Ads
2. Go to your Responsive Search Ads
3. Find any headline with "near you" or "in your area"
4. Replace with:
   * "[Your City]'s Top [Service]"
   * "[Service] in [Your City]"
   * "[Your City]'s Most Trusted [Service]"
Time required: 10 minutes
Expected impact: 50-100% improvement in conversion rate
This is the fastest, easiest win in this entire playbook.
________________


Part 6: Common Expensive Mistakes
Mistake #1: No Conversion Tracking
Companies affected: At least 3 in our dataset showed signs of this
The problem: Can't optimize what you can't measure.
The cost: Wasting 30-50% of budget on campaigns that don't work.
The fix:
* Set up Google Ads conversion tracking
* Track both form submissions AND phone calls
* Use call tracking numbers (CallRail, CallTrackingMetrics)
* Verify tracking is working before spending more
________________


Mistake #2: Using Display Network
Example: One company spent $255 on display with 0 conversions
The problem: Display ads don't work for local service businesses. People aren't browsing the internet thinking "I need cleaning today."
The fix: Turn off Display Network. Search only.
________________


Mistake #3: Wrong Campaign Types
Example: One company's "website traffic" campaign - $3,159 CPA
The problem: Optimizing for clicks/traffic instead of leads.
The fix: Only run campaigns optimized for conversions. Delete anything optimized for clicks, traffic, or impressions.
________________


Mistake #4: Generic Copy
Evidence: "Near you" headlines had 0.1-3% conversion vs 20-28% for city-specific
The problem: You're competing with every cleaning company's generic ads.
The fix: Use the copy templates in Part 1. City name + authority + service type.
________________


Mistake #5: Broad Geographic Targeting
Evidence: Best performers had tight geographic focus
The problem: Paying for clicks from people 30+ miles away who will never book.
The fix:
* 10-15 mile radius max
* Exclude areas you don't serve
* Bid higher in affluent zip codes
________________


Mistake #6: No Negative Keywords
Evidence: Search term reports likely show tons of irrelevant searches
The problem: Wasting money on searches like "cleaning jobs," "cleaning products," "DIY cleaning."
The fix: Build a negative keyword list:
* jobs
* careers
* hiring
* DIY
* products
* supplies
* equipment
* franchise
* free
* cheap
* (your city name if targeting different cities)
________________


Mistake #7: Not Tracking ROI
Evidence: Most companies didn't know which campaigns were profitable
The problem: Can't make smart decisions without knowing lead value.
The fix:
* Calculate average lead value
* Track lifetime value, not just first job
* Know your maximum acceptable CPA
* Kill campaigns above that threshold

Final Thoughts
The data doesn't lie:
Some cleaning companies get leads for $29. Others pay $324 for the same lead.
The difference isn't budget. The difference isn't luck.
The difference is:
1. ✅ Using city-specific headlines instead of "near you"
2. ✅ Running search campaigns instead of display
3. ✅ Having strong CTAs instead of weak ones
4. ✅ Building trust instead of making vague promises
You now have the exact formulas used by the top performers.
The question is: Will you implement them?
Most people will read this, nod along, and do nothing.
The winners will log into Google Ads this week and start making changes.
Which one will you be?
